# Titanic Survival Prediction using SVM

This repository contains a machine learning project using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. The goal was to apply SVM for classification and visualize the decision boundary.

## 📂 Files

- `SVM_titanic_dataset.ipynb` - Main Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, model training, visualization, and prediction.
- `train (1).csv` - Training dataset from the Titanic competition.
- `test (1).csv` - Test dataset used for final predictions.
- `gender_submission.csv` - Sample submission file.

## 🔍 Techniques Used

- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Feature Scaling with StandardScaler
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF Kernel
- Model Evaluation & Accuracy Score
- Decision Boundary Visualization (Age vs Fare)
- CSV submission file creation

## ✅ Output

Final model accuracy: **80.45%**

Below is a decision boundary plot generated using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the Titanic dataset using only two features: **Age** and **Fare** (after scaling).

### 📌 Note:
This project was built for hands-on practice and learning how SVM works on a real-world dataset
